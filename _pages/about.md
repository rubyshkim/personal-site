I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan. I received my PhD in Mathematics from Duke University in May 2022. My research interests are in mathematical biology studied using methods from dynamical systems and scientific computing.

I have seven years of experience teaching college mathematics including calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and mathematical modeling. I also received the [Certificate in College Teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching/) from Duke University.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
