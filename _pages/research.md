My research interests are in mathematical biology studied using methods from dynamical systems, data analysis, and scientific computing. I am driven to investigate human health problems using advanced mathematical tools. My main areas of focus have been: (1) Development and analysis of mechanistic models of circadian phenomena, (2) Analysis of large-scale wrist-wearable activity, heart rate, and sleep data, and (3) Mathematical models that advance women’s health.

**Dynamics of the Circadian Timekeeping System**

The circadian timekeeping system is regulated across multiple spatial and time scales that span many orders of magnitude. At the molecular level, each cell has its very own transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) that drives ~24hr periodic rhythms of clock genes and proteins. Mathematically, this molecular clock is a stable limit cycle that can be influenced by external forcing by light, food, and other environmental cues. The molecular clocks of each cell are coupled to each other on a large-scale network (from a graph-theoretic perspective, with many billion nodes and many trillion edges). Cells can communicate with each other through synaptic transmission (milliseconds to minutes) or other types of paracrine signaling (minutes to hours). These dynamical systems on networks create a highly robust and flexible system of both biological and mathematical interest. The following papers are related to the dynamics of circadian timekeeping:

**Models of the Menstrual Cycle and Health Impacts**

Sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone significantly affect our physiology, resulting in sex-related differences in disease outcomes and reactions to drugs. For example, there are major impacts of sex hormones on one-carbon metabolism (OCM), which is central to the synthesis of building blocks (DNA, proteins, etc.) for cells and tissues in the body. OCM disruptions are linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders, as well as deficiencies in nutrients such as B-vitamins and choline. However, women and people who menstruate have been historically underrepresented in medical studies.
See this [2024 article on "Why we know so little about women’s health."](https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health) Mathematical models can be used to help advance personalized health care approaches and allow for a more inclusive understanding of human health.
